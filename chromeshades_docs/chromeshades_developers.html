ChromeShades Developer Documentation
</h1>

<p>ChromeShades is a tool to help you make your site more
accessible to blind users. For information on how to use ChromeShades,
<a href="chromeshades_help.html">see the help page</a>. This document
is about the internal details of how ChromeShades works.</p>

<p>The fundamental idea behind ChromeShades is to replace the page style
with a custom stylesheet that visually depicts potential accessibility
issues. So why isn't it as simple as just a single CSS file?
</p>

<ul>
<li>First, the ChromeShades stylesheet loads before the page's stylesheets -
so we have to specifically disable the page's stylesheets.
<li>We don't want to completely disable the page's stylesheets because we
want a few styles to be preserved, such as display and visibility. So we
need to rewrite each style rule from the page to include only those. This
is further complicated by same-origin restrictions that make it trickier to
modify the page's stylesheets.
<li>Document elements with inline styles normally override other stylesheets;
we need to scan the document and remove any inline styles except those
affecting display or visibility. We also need to reprocess every time the
document is modified.
<li>With the reformatting, iframes are no longer properly resized. The
page needs to be modified so that iframes are seamlessly integrated into
the content.
</ul>

<p>In addition, here are the things ChromeShades does that can't be
done just with a single stylesheet:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Images and plug-ins are prevented from being loaded so that they
can be replaced with their alternate or fallback content.
<li>Everything in the document is indented based on the heading level.
<li>The text of a button or link is replaced with its title or aria-label
attribute, if any.
<li>Legacy HTML style attributes like bgcolor and cellpadding have to be
removed on each element, they can't be overridden entirely using CSS.
<li>Layout-only tables in a quirks-mode document can't be linearized without
messing with the DOM a little.
</ul>

<h3>Modifying page stylesheets</h3>

<p>
When ChromeShades starts processing a page, it iterates over all of the
stylesheets and tries to "fix" all of the rules in each one - essentially
removing any styles other than display and visibility. For inline
&lt;style&gt; elements or stylesheets loaded from CSS files with the same
origin, it can do so by iterating over the rules in the stylesheet, something
like this:
</p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-js">
  var sheet = document.styleSheets[i];
  for (var j = 0; j < sheet.cssRules.length; j++) {
    var rule = sheet.cssRules[j];
    var displayValue = rule.style.getPropertyValue('display');
    var displayPriority = rule.style.getPropertyPriority('display');

    ...

    rule.style.cssText = 'display: ' + displayValue + ' !' + displayPriority;
  }
</xmp>

<p>However, when a stylesheet is encountered that's not from the same origin,
it can't be modified - its cssRules property will be empty. As a workaround,
ChromeShades sends a message to its background page with the stylesheet url,
the background page fetches the stylesheet again, and sends the contents to
the page, where the original stylesheet is disabled
(<tt>styleSheet.disabled = true</tt>) and the fresh copy is inserted as an
inline &lt;style&gt; tag, which can be modified using the function above.</p>

<h3>Design decisions</h3>

<p>
One of the primary goals of ChromeShades is not to "break" pages. You should
be able to continue to interact with a site while ChromeShades is on.
It may be more difficult to use, of course, because the layout is linearized
and images have been replaced with their alt tags, etc. - but essentially
entering text, clicking on buttons and links, and any other methods of
interacting with the page should continue to function as before.
</p>

<p>
In order to reconcile this goal with the fact that ChromeShades still needs
to make some serious changes to the layout, it's necessary to make some
design assumptions based on common JavaScript coding patterns. For example,
any page that bases its behavior on the computed style of an element will
almost certainly break or change behavior, because the whole point of
ChromeShades is to change the computed style. However, we assume most sites
do not rely on this.
</p>

<p>Assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It is not safe</strong>
    to change the className of an element. Many pages
    depent on checking an element's class to determine its state.

<li><strong>It is not safe</strong>
    to insert or delete DOM nodes in the middle of the document body.
    Many pages depend on one
    element being the first child or first sibling of another, so inserting
    and deleting elements in the middle of the page could break things.

<li><strong>It is safe</strong> to modify the inline style of an element.
    Most pages don't check the inline style to determine state.

<li><strong>It is safe</strong> to add new attributes to an existing eleemnt,
    especially if they are namespaced (all prefixed with chromeshades_) so
    there's no chance they'll interfere with custom attributes used by the
    page, or future HTML standard attributes.
</ul>

<p>
These decisions have strongly influenced the implementation. If the underlying
assumptions were found to be violated on any significant sites, or in a
popular javascript library, that would be good reason to reconsider the
decision and rewrite portions of ChromeShades.
</p>

<p>
One idea that was prototyped but does not appear in the
current version is to create new DOM nodes and absolute-position them
over elements they're meant to replace or complement - this is a great
way to add information to the page without affecting the DOM order in a way
that could break many apps. This idea might be worth revisiting if any of the
above assumptions ends up being bad.
