ChromeVox is a Chrome extension that turns Chrome into a self-voicing browser.
It runs on ChromeOs, Chrome and Android (as AndroidVox).

BUILDING:

The rhino Javascript intepreter and the Google closure compiler are required.
Please update the top of Makefile with their paths.

The Closure libraries don't have a good packaging system.  The easiest way to
get the required tools is to download them from code.google.com and
move them to /usr/local/lib/closure.  The directory should have the following
files:

compiler.jar
closurebuilder.py
depstree.py
depswriter.py
jscompiler.py
source.py
treescan.py

To build AndroidVox, run 'make androidVoxDev.js'

RUNNING:

TODO(clchen): Add instructions for running androidVox on a Android device.
