  <h2>Navigation in Detail.</h2>
  <p>
    ChromeVox allows you to view a particular page at different levels of detail. What you have
    seen so far is group level. The ChromeVox right arrow and ChromeVox left arrow shortcuts allow
    you to move among the levels of detail. ChromeVox right will increase the level of
    detail - think of it as "zooming in" to content on the page. ChromeVox left will decrease the
    level of detail, so you can get a broader overview of page content.
  </p>
  <p>
    ChromeVox will announce the current detail level after you switch. The group level is the
    least specific level of detail. Character level is the most detailed level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving to an object. Object level is a more specific level of detail than group level. At the
    object level, you can move within groups to view individual web objects like links, buttons,
    headers, and edit fields. So once you navigate to a group that you want to explore in more
    detail, simply press ChromeVox with right arrow to zoom ChromeVox in to specific objects inside
    the group.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try selecting the second listitem object within the next group by zooming into the group with
    ChromeVox right arrow. Then try zooming back out by pressing ChromeVox left arrow.  Try this on
    the following group by first moving to it in group mode with ChromeVox down.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>apple</li>
    <li>orange</li>
    <li>banana</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Did you see the second listitem object?  Was it orange?  Keep moving around until you feel
    comfortable.
  </p>
      
  <p>
    Once you get a feel for how object and group navigation works, you can use this to
    quickly move around a page. If you are not interested in any links within a group,
    simply move past the group to the next. However, if you are interested in a link or other object
    within a group, press ChromeVox right to zoom to the object detail level and explore the
    contents of the group.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can effectively skim through this tutorial by using groups. After hearing the
    first sentence of a paragraph, you can move on or continue listening. The next section
    of the tutorial will explain how you can adjust the ChromeVox speech.
