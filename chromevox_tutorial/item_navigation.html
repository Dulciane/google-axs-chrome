  <h2>Jump commands.</h2>
  <p>
    Let's talk more about objects on the page. ChromeVox allows you to jump to the next and previous
    objects of certain types such as headers, links, and edit fields. This helps you locate objects
    of interest; for example, you can scan the links on a page to find the "contact us" link.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jump commands are invoked by a pair of keys, which you tap one at a time while holding down the
    ChromeVox shortcut keys. The first key specifies the direction you wish to move on the page, and
    the second key specifies the object type. You specify the direction you want to jump using the N
    or P keys (which stand for "next" and "previous"). You then tap the additional key to specify
    the type of object you want to jump to. So this means that to activate a jump command, you need
    to hold down the ChromeVox shortcut keys, tap the direction key (either N or P), and while
    you're still holding down the ChromeVox keys, tap the object-specific key. Please note that you
    don't have to keep pressing down the direction key while you tap the object-specific key.
  </p>
  <p>
    To jump to a link, press and hold the ChromeVox keys first. Then tap N to specify you want to
    move forward and tap L to jump to the next link. To move to the previous link, press
    ChromeVox P and then L. Try jumping between the two links in next group. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href='#'>First link</a><br>
    <a href='#'>Second link. Continue on to the next paragraph by pressing ChromeVox Down</a>
  </p>
    To jump to the next heading, hold the ChromeVox keys while tapping N and then H. Jump to the
    previous heading while holding ChromeVox and tapping P and then H. There are a few headings
    following this paragraph group. Try exploring them. The next instructions are in the paragraph
    with the heading titled "Moving On."
