    <h2>Using Left and Right to take smaller steps. </h2>
    <p>
        You've already learned how to explore a page using the ChromeVox up and ChromeVox down
        shortcuts, and change the amount of detail you see by using ChromeVox minus and ChromeVox
        equals. If you think of ChromeVox up and ChromeVox down as taking big steps backwards or
        forwards through the page, you can think about changing the level of detail as changing the
        "size of the step." In this section, we're going to introduce another way to take steps
        through the page using ChromeVox left arrow and ChromeVox right arrow. Just like ChromeVox
        up and ChromeVox down, you can use ChromeVox left arrow and ChromeVox right arrow to move
        backwards and forwards through the page. Left moves backwards just like up does, and right
        moves forwards just like down does. But left and right allow you to take smaller steps
        forwards or backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's try taking a small step forward to get a better idea of how this works. Use ChromeVox
        equals until you get to sentence level navigation. Press ChromeVox down. You just moved
        foward by sentence. Now, press ChromeVox right. You're now moving forward by word! Press
        ChromeVox left to move backward by word. If you press ChromeVox up or ChromeVox down, you'll
        go back to moving by sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use this technique to take a small step ahead or behind where you are on a page to
        get a more detailed look. For example, if you're navigating by object using ChromeVox down
        and go past a section of the page that sounded interesting, you can use ChromeVox left to
        return to that section at the sentence level. Or if you're navigating by word and would like
        to check the spelling of the word you just heard, you can use ChromeVox up to move before
        the word and then use ChromeVox right to move through the word character-by-character.
        Whatever the level of detail you've currently selected, ChromeVox up and down will move by
        that level, while ChromeVox left and right will move at the next more detailed level.

	The next section of the tutorial will talk about jumping between objects on a page.
