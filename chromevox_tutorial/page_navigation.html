    <h2>Moving around a page.</h2>
    <p>
    ChromeVox divides a page into groups.  In this way, you can get a general overview of the page
    before diving into something you may be interested in.  Try navigating into the following
    collection of links by pressing ChromeVox down to select the group 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="web">web</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Now press ChromeVox up to move back to the collection of links.  When you feel comfortable
      with how this works, move back to this group by pressing ChromeVox down, and then to the next
      group by pressing ChromeVox down again.
      </p>
