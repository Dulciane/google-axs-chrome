    <h2>ChromeVox Version 1.16.0 Release Notes</h2>
    <p>Greetings, your version of ChromeVox has just been updated! We hope this new version will
      solve some of the issues you've been reporting in emails and on the Issues list. This change
      also includes some big changes to the way ChromeVox navigation works, including making table
      navigation much easier.</p>

    <p>The following is a summary of the changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arrow Navigation
        <ul>
          <li>The left and right arrow keys will not change granularity anymore. Use ChromeVox +
            Minus to move to a less detailed level (like the left arrow key used to do). Use
            ChromeVox + Equals to move to a more detailed level (like the right arrow key used to
            do).
          <li>Instead, the left and right arrow keys will explore backwards and forwards at the
            *next most detailed* navigation level. So if you're in object mode and you press
            ChromeVox + Right, you'll move forward by *sentence*. If you're in sentence mode and
            you press ChromeVox + Left, you'll move backward by *word*.
        </ul>
      <li>Table Navigation
        <ul>
          <li>"Table Mode" will now start automatically when you enter a data table, no matter
            which mode you're using. Inside a table, "table mode" is the same thing as "group mode."
          <li>While using table mode, the ChromeVox + Left, ChromeVox + Right, ChromeVox + Up, and
            ChromeVox + Down arrow keys navigate around each cell of the table.
          <li>To leave a table while in table mode, press ChromeVox + Down until you get to the last
            row of the table (you'll hear an earcon). When you hear the earcon, press
            ChromeVox + Down again in order to leave.
          <li>If you'd like to explore the table at a more granular level (like sentence or word)
            instead of navigating by cell, you can leave table mode by pressing ChromeVox + Equals.
            You can always re-enter table mode and start navigating cells using the arrow keys
            again by going back up to group mode (by pressing ChromeVox + Minus).
          <li>You can force ChromeVox to jump outside of the table by pressing ChromeVox + T + E.
          <li>ChromeVox will try to intelligently decide  whether a table is a data table or a
            layout table. We look for signals like the table not having a border, having one row or
            one column, having nested tables inside of itself, etc.
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>We're making these change so we can simplify table navigation. Please give us feedback on
      these changes on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/axs-chrome-discuss">
      ChromeVox discussion list</a>.
