Installing ChromeVox on Mac
</h1>
<p>
ChromeVox is an open source JavaScript screen reader designed for Chrome OS. Although ChromeVox is targeted for Chrome OS, it will also work under Chrome 14 (Beta) on Mac. ChromeVox is still BETA - there are definitely a few rough edges, but we are iterating rapidly to improve the product. These following instructions have been tested with VoiceOver and found to be working. 
</p>
<p>Once you have ChromeVox installed, press Command + F5 to switch off VoiceOver when you are navigating web content in Chrome with ChromeVox. When you want to go back to using VoiceOver, press Command + F5 again to turn VoiceOver back on. You can turn off ChromeVox by going to "Tools", "Extensions", and then disabling ChromeVox.
