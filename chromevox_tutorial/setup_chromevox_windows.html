Installing ChromeVox on Windows
</h1>
<p>
ChromeVox is an open source JavaScript screen reader designed for Chrome OS. Although ChromeVox is targeted for Chrome OS, it will also work under Chrome 14 (Beta) on Windows. ChromeVox is still BETA - there are definitely a few rough edges, but we are iterating rapidly to improve the product. These following instructions have been tested with JAWS 12 and found to be working. 
</p>
<p>Once you have ChromeVox installed, you will be navigating web content in Chrome with ChromeVox and everything else with your existing screen reader. If you wish to go back to navigating web content with your existing screen reader, you can turn off ChromeVox by going to "Tools", "Extensions", and then disabling ChromeVox.
