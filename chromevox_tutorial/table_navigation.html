    <h2>Moving around tables.</h2>
    <p>
        Now that you know the basics of navigating around a page with ChromeVox, we want to
        start introducing some features of ChromeVox that make it easier to perform more complex
        navigation. We'll start with table navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ChromeVox's table navigation feature enables you to explore structured data quickly. You
        can think of it as a special navigation method that allows you to move between each cell in
        a table.
    </p>
    <p>
        Table navigation mode starts automatically when you have crossed into a data table. You will
        hear a special earcon and ChromeVox will announce the number of rows and columns in the
        the table. To move between cells, use the following commands:
        <ul>
            <li>ChromeVox + Up for the cell above the current cell</li>
            <li>ChromeVox + Down for the cell below the current cell</li>
            <li>ChromeVox + Left for the cell to the left of the current cell</li>
            <li>ChromeVox + Right for the cell to the right of the current cell</li>
        </ul>
        Please note that the ChromeVox Up, Down, Left, and Right commands act differently in table
        mode. They move you between cells, not forward and backward in the page. To leave a table
        while in table mode, press ChromeVox Down until you get to the last row of the table and
        you hear an earcon. When you hear the earcon, press ChromeVox Down again in order to leave
        the table and return to navigating forward and backward in the page. You can also force
        ChromeVox to leave the table by pressing ChromeVox + T + E anywhere in the table. This
        command toggles table mode on and off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Table navigation mode is a feature of group navigation. If you change to a different level
        of detail - such as object level or sentence level - by pressing ChromeVox Equals while you
        are in the table, you will leave table navigation mode and the arrow keys will function like
        they normally do. To enter table mode again, use ChromeVox Minus to move back up to group
        level navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ChromeVox tries to determine whether a table on a page is a data table or a layout table.
        This step is necessary because some pages still use tables for visual layout even though
        it's bad design practice and bad for accessibility. If a table contains data, ChromeVox
        will start table mode. If ChromeVox determines the table is just being used for layout,
        table mode won't start and you'll navigate the content just like you usually do. But if you
        want to try starting table navigation mode anyway (ChromeVox might have made a mistake),
        you can press ChromeVox + T + E. ChromeVox will tell you if it can't find a table anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try navigating through the simple table following this paragraph using the commands listed
        earlier to move between cells. Remember, you can press ChromeVox + T + E at any time
        within the table to enter or leave table navigation mode.
    </p>
