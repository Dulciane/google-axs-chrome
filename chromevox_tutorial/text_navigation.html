    <h2>Moving around text. </h2>
    <p>
        Continuing with our exploration of levels of detail, we represent text units such as
        paragraphs, sentences, words, and characters each as an additional level of detail.
        Imagine that any given object contains some amount of text; you can explore its text
        by increasing the ChromeVox detail level and therefore "zooming in" to parts of the text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try exploring the text of this object by moving to a more detailed level by pressing
        ChromeVox right. Move back to less detailed levels with ChromeVox left arrow. ChromeVox
        will announce the new detail level you have set.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have set your desired detail level with ChromeVox right or left, you can navigate
        around the page at that level of detail with ChromeVox up or down.  Try moving through this
        text by word.  Press ChromeVox right until you hear "words", then press ChromeVox down to
        move forward word by word.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a link and a heading you can try exploring. Try moving through them by character
        and word using the commands you have seen above.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Example of navigating through elements of a webpage to hear text.</h1>
    <a href="#">The ChromeVox Tutorial</a>
    <p>
        Feel free to change the level of detail and explore text that may have hard to catch
        instructions. Also, feel free to move to a less detailed level when you simply want
        to skim a section of text. Finally, notice that you can keep moving by any of the text
        increments until you reach the end of the page. This means you can pass from a heading right
        into a link if moving by word.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a challenge for you: try spelling the imaginary word fleurppel inside the text box
        that follows this paragraph, the same way that it is spelled here. After you spell it, press
        the "Check Spelling" button following the text box to see if you were correct. If you were,
        the link to advance to the next section of the tutorial will display after the button! If
        you were wrong, you can try again or click on the "Skip exercise" link if you want to
        continue anyway.
    </p>

    <script>
        function validateSpelling() {
            var spellbox = document.getElementById("spellbox");
            var resultDiv = document.getElementById('result');
            if (resultDiv.hasChildNodes()) {
                resultDiv.removeChild(resultDiv.firstChild)
            }
            if (spellbox.value == 'fleurppel') {
                var advanceNode = document.createElement('a');
                advanceNode.href = 'item_navigation.html';
                advanceNode.innerHTML =
                    'Congratulations! Continue to the next section, Object Navigation.';
                var resultElt = document.getElementById('result');
                resultElt.innerHTML = '';
                resultElt.appendChild(advanceNode);
                advanceNode.focus();
            } else {
                document.getElementById('result').innerHTML =
                    'Misspelled fleurppel! Go back to the text box to try again.';
            }
        }
</script>
