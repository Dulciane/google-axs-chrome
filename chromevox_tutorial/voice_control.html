    <!-- Removed language about changing speech synthesizer because that functionality has changed
    in ChromeOS -->
    <p>
        Let's take a break from navigating around the page. ChromeVox
        comes with the ability to control your speech synthesizer with an assortment of commands
        that change the rate, pitch, and volume of ChromeVox speech. These commands are listed
        below. Remember that you can press ChromeVox with right arrow to zoom ChromeVox in to
        specific objects inside this group of commands.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Press ChromeVox hyphen or ChromeVox equals to decrease or increase the speaking
        rate.</li>
        <li>Press ChromeVox left bracket or ChromeVox right bracket to decrease or increase the
        volume of speech.</li>
        <li>Press ChromeVox semicolon or ChromeVox apostrophe to decrease or increase the pitch of
        speech.</li>
        <li>Press the system volume keys (located above the hyphen and equals keys) to change the
        overall system volume. This will also increase the ChromeVox speech volume.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You can adjust the way your speech sounds at any time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The next section of the tutorial will show you how you can move through even finer detail
        levels such as sentences or words.
