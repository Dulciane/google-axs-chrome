<!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" >ChromeVox is built as a Chrome extension &#8212; see <span class="cite">[<a 
href="paperli3.html#Xgoogle-chrome-extensions">9</a>]</span>. A detailed explanation of
Chrome extensions is beyond the scope of this paper; however, we briefly
outline the design of Chrome extensions in the context of the ChromeVox
implementation.
<!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >   A Chrome <span 
class="cmti-10">extension </span>is a zipped bundle of files&#8212; HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
images, and anything else needed by the extension &#8212; that adds functionality to the
Google Chrome browser. Chrome extensions were inspired by Mozilla Firefox add-ons
&#8212; in particular Greasemonkey, a Firefox add-on that made it easy to inject custom
JavaScript into specific webpages &#8212; see&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="paperli3.html#Xpilgrim2005ght">12</a>]</span>. A Chrome extension consists of
primarily two parts: injected content and background content. The injected content
of an extension consists of style sheets and JavaScript code that can be added to
every running page. Content scripts run in a separate JavaScript context called an
<span 
class="cmti-10">isolated world </span>that does not share any global state with the scripts running in the
page, while still having access to the DOM. Note that a content script functions <span 
class="cmti-10">not</span>
as part of the extension that it was packaged with, but as part of the loaded page
into which it is <span 
class="cmti-10">injected</span>. Background content consists of custom UI that
the extension wants to show (built like any web app, with HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript) and purely background scripts that are used to coordinate
between different pages or keep track of global state. JavaScript running in the
background portion of an extension can access some APIs that are not normally
available to web pages, including information about bookmarks and tabs,
speech APIs, and the ability to make web requests without the same-origin
restriction. Content scripts and background scripts communicate using message
passing.
<!--l. 275--><p class="indent" >   A Chrome extension can provide any or all of the following types of
functionality:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Web mashups that present an optimized interface to oft-performed tasks.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Additional  user  interface  affordances  such  as  browser  action  icons  for
     performing common actions.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">New behaviors for web pages and applications in the browser.</li></ul>
