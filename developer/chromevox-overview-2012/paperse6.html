<!--l. 705--><p class="noindent" >As covered in sec.&#x00A0;<a 
href="papersu2.html#x4-30001.2">1.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:srd-chromeos --></a>, ChromeVox is just another web application on Chrome&#x00A0;OS &#8212;
see fig.&#x00A0;<a 
href="papersu2.html#x4-30012">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:screen-reader-chromeos --></a>. It injects accessibility affordances for blind and low-vision users into all
running web applications as part of its default behavior. In addition, ChromeVox
exposes a light-weight API that allows web applications to customize the overall
accessibility experience for a given application. This API allows us to experiment
with new strategies for adding accessibility to web applications that stretch the limits
of today&#8217;s web platform. In this section, we&#8217;ll illustrate this with a concrete
example.
<!--l. 717--><p class="indent" >   The word processor in Google&#x00A0;Docs is designed to provide a desktop-like
experience for WYSIWYGS text editing. A key design requirement was to enable
collaboration across the web in all supported browser/OS combinations, and to
enable reliable round-tripping of the document independent of browser differences in
HTML serialization.
<!--l. 724--><p class="indent" >   Google Docs achieves this by storing an in-memory model of the document
content in JavaScript that is updated continuously in response to user input. As this
model updates, the results are rendered to the visual display by appropriately
updating the DOM, including drawing the visual caret and appropriately styling the
presentation to match the user&#8217;s intent. Notice that in this implementation, the
content being edited is not directly serialized in the HTML DOM; instead, the
implementation uses an underlying Model, View, Controller (MVC) abstraction
where the document model as encapsulated in the internal JavaScript data
structures are continuously reflected in the view layer represented by the
HTML DOM. The controller, which handles user input is implemented as
an off-screen text input field that the user never sees; all aspects of user
interaction are managed by the web application itself, rather than relying on the
browser.
<!--l. 740--><p class="indent" >   The MVC design pattern adopted by Google Docs enables users on different
browser/OS combinations to collaborate effectively without differences in HTML
serialization among browsers affecting the ability to effectively round-trip content.
Thus, this word-processor as designed has a number of advantages over more
traditional approaches of using HTML&#8217;s <span 
class="cmsl-10">content-editable </span>feature. However, it
presents an interesting challenge to traditional approaches to access-enabling web
applications that rely solely on the document markup containing the needed
accessibility affordances. To illustrate, access technologies like screen readers watch
for the insertion caret when producing spoken feedback within a word processor.
However, in the described implementation, the insertion caret is drawn to the screen
by the web application along with the stylized visual presentation of the content
being authored; the controller that receives user input is itself never rendered to the
                                                                  

                                                                  
screen.
<!--l. 758--><p class="indent" >   To help provide better accessibility in web applications that extend the browser
platform, ChromeVox exposes a light-weight API that enables Web developers affect
the following aspects of the overall accessibility experience:
<!--l. 763--><p class="indent" >
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">

     layer.

     to the navigation position maintained by the application.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 771--><p class="indent" >   The Google&#x00A0;Docs product uses this API to implement an accessible word
processor in conjunction with ChromeVox. The same techniques are used by Google
Spreadsheets; this provides an end-user accessibility experience that closely matches
and will eventually surpass accessibility that users have come to expect in desktop
applications.
