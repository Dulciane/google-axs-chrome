<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >First, we briefly outline the architecture of adaptive technologies such as screen
readers found on traditional operating systems. Here are the design requirements and
constraints under which these were designed:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Applications  such  as  word  processors,  spreadsheets  and  mail  readers
     implement platform-specific APIs that provide accessible information and
     control of their user interfaces.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Adaptive technologies run as separate processes and communicate with
     applications using these APIs.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">These adaptive technologies expose commands and capabilities to users,
     and provide alternative feedback via text-to-speech or braille.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">When generic platform APIs fall short, many applications expose custom
     interfaces that adaptive technology can leverage to create a customized
     experience for that particular application. In other cases, some adaptive
     technology may resort to hacks including &#8220;screen scraping&#8221; to provide a
     more accessible experience for users.</li></ul>
<!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   Microsoft Windows accessibility APIs include Microsoft Active Accessibility
(MSAA), which was the original accessibility API for Windows; IAccessible2, an
extension to MSAA developed by the Linux Foundation; and UI Automation, a
newer API from Microsoft. All of these Windows APIs are Component Object Model
(COM) interfaces, which are supported in almost every major programming
language. Mac OS X and iOS support the NSAccessibility protocol, which is available
                                                                  

                                                                  
to any application built using the Objective-C Cocoa APIs, and a bridge between
NSAccessibility and Java&#8217;s accessibility API is built-in. Most Linux distributions
support the GNOME Accessibility Toolkit (ATK), which was developed jointly with
the IAccessible2 API for Windows and shares a compatible semantic programming
model. Adaptive technologies such as screen readers that leverage these APIs to
provide accessibility may be provided by the operating system or by third
parties.
<!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   In this environment, an <span 
class="cmti-10">accessible </span>application is one that implements the
platform-specific accessibility API within its user interface. Because native operating
system widgets and many other user interface toolkits already implement the
accessibility APIs, applications built exclusively using these widgets may be
accessible without any extra work on the part of the application developer.
However, such an application may still be more difficult for an adaptive
technology user to work with if the conceptual design of the application made
assumptions, <span 
class="cmti-10">e.g.</span>,&#x00A0;that the user can see the spatial layout of controls. Thus, the
application <span 
class="cmti-10">publishes </span>information that is of interest to adaptive technology,
<span 
class="cmti-10">e.g.</span>,&#x00A0;the label of the currently focused widget. Screen Readers <span 
class="cmti-10">subscribe </span>to
this information via the platform accessibility API&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x3-20011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:screen-reader-win-macos --></a>. When working with
an <span 
class="cmti-10">accessible </span>application, the screen reader receives notifications via the
accessibility API and subsequently provides appropriate alternative feedback,
<span 
class="cmti-10">e.g.</span>,&#x00A0;by speaking the label of the widget that is focused. Additionally, adaptive
technologies like screen readers can query application state and in certain cases
even drive the application, <span 
class="cmti-10">e.g.</span>,&#x00A0;by setting focus to a given user interface
control.
