<!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" >Chrome&#x00A0;OS is an operating system created by Google. A key insight behind its
design is that it is now possible to do most (if not all) of one&#8217;s work within a web
browser. Building on this insight, Chrome&#x00A0;OS machines boot up within seconds of
turning on and immediately launch Chrome; from that point onwards all user
interaction happens within the browser and all applications are implemented as web
applications.
<!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >   We created ChromeVox to be a screen reader built into Chrome&#x00A0;OS which led to
the following design requirements:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">All applications such as word-processors, mail readers and spreadsheets
     are implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">All user interaction happens within the web browser.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The screen reader needs to respond to user interaction within all browser
     tabs. Though the user is accessing web content the majority of the time,
     the screen reader must still provide access to everything else on the system
     &#8212; toolbars, menus, and dialogs that are part of Chrome and Chrome&#x00A0;OS
     and which might not be implemented in the web programming model.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Alternative  feedback  such  as  speech  feedback  needs  to  be  either
     implemented  using  web  technology,  or  provided  on  the  platform  and
     accessed via web APIs.</li></ul>
<!--l. 198--><p class="indent" >   Since all applications on Chrome&#x00A0;OS are <span 
class="cmti-10">web </span>applications running in Chrome,
and since an increasing proportion of the platform&#8217;s user interface is itself
implemented in the web programming model, we chose to do away with the
traditional metaphor of applications communicating via an accessibility API
intermediated by the operating system. Instead, ChromeVox uses the HTML
Document Object Model (DOM) as the means of communicating with web
applications running within Chrome&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x4-30012">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:screen-reader-chromeos --></a>.
<!--l. 207--><p class="indent" >   For the small portion of the user interface that is not implemented in HTML, we
expose these interaction elements to JavaScript via a light-weight custom interface.
User interface elements in the &#8220;chrome of Chrome&#8221;, <span 
class="cmti-10">e.g.</span>,&#x00A0;toolbar buttons, menus,
and the address bar, raise events in response to user interaction that in turn produce
                                                                  

                                                                  
appropriate alternative feedback through ChromeVox. But as HTML evolves to
support ever-richer user interaction, we are seeing some of these native user interface
components migrating to a web interaction model, possibly obviating these additional
APIs over time.
