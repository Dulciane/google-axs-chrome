As we move away from the traditional methods of publishing and teaching to the
provision of web-based content more and more scientific and teaching material
becomes available online often in novel formats such as interactive diagrams or
simulations. Ensuring full accessibility to this material for users that rely
primarily on voice output from their computer becomes a challenging
problem. Already the text to speech translation of fairly conventional
scientific content like mathematical formulae, which contain rich structure and
for which a well defined markup language exists, is non-trivial.

We present our efforts of making the speech translation of
mathematical formulas a first class citizen in a general screen
reader. We demonstrate how we can deal with the collection of formats
that is presently used to render mathematics on the web and how we
extend the idea of letting users engage with content on different
levels of granularity to specialised content like maths.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
As we move away from the traditional methods of publishing and
teaching to the provision of web-based content more and more
scientific and teaching material becomes available online often in
novel formats such as interactive diagrams or simulations. Ensuring
full accessibility to this material for users that rely primarily on
voice output from their computer becomes a challenging
problem. Already the text to speech translation of fairly conventional
scientific content like mathematical formulae, which contain rich
structure and for which a well defined markup language exists, is
non-trivial.


In this paper we report on our effort to integrate the basic support
for voicing mathematical content on the web into the ChromeVox screen
reader. We shall present some of the main challenges to making maths
on the web accessible, where it is given in a variety of ways and
formats. We shall outline the rule based approach we have pursued and
how it fits with ChromeVox's philosophy to enable users to explore
content at different levels of granularity. It has led to an
implementation of a flexible speech rule engine that allows to
customise the reading experience along several axes and that also
provides an API for easy adaptation to specialised content by users
and web site authors.

\section{Mathematics on the Web}
\label{sec:math}

Ideally, mathematical formulas on a webpage should be represented in its own
specialised markup language, MathML~\cite{mathml}. But although MathML is
officially part of the HTML5 standard~\cite{html5}, not all of the major
browsers also implement MathML rendering, hence support for formulas included in
pure MathML on web pages is sketchy. Consequently in reality mathematics on the
web comes in a variety of flavours.

Alternatively, formulas are often still given as images. 

In order 
one had to provide text-to-speech support for all 

We will briefly sketch the different formats we have to deal with in this
section.

\subsection{MathML}
\label{sec:mathml}

\ldots briefly mention distinction between presentation and content MathML
\ldots

It provides markup for the most common layout elements encountered in
mathematics, such as sub- and superscripts, fractions, square roots etc.  In
addition it provides markup to define mathematics specific styles, spacing, etc.
as well as specialised attributes such as for fonts, accents, etc.


\subsection{MathJax Rendering}
\label{sec:mathjax}

MathJax is a javascript display engine~\cite{mathjax} with the goal to display
mathematical formulas consistently on all browsers. It can use a number of input
formats and translates them into simple HTML markup that visually render a maths
expression in a browser, regardless of whether the browser supports MathML.
In particular, it can work with MathML markup, {\LaTeX}, and
AsciiMath~\cite{asciimath}.



\subsection{Hidden Markup}
\label{sec:images}

Traditionally mathematical formulas would be embedded into web content using
images generated from documents that were previously generated with systems
specialising on rendering mathematics, for example, {\LaTeX}. And despite the
obvious drawbacks of having content in images, such as lack of scalability, this
method is still an option that is chosen by many major web sites containing
mathematical content (e.g., Wikipedia~\cite{wikipedia},
MathWorld~\cite{mathworld}), to provide content consistently at reliable
performance, independent of third party libraries.  While the mathematics given
in image form is effectively inaccessible, the original source from which a
formula has been generated is often given in form of alternative text attribute
of the image tag.  For instance, in the case of Wikipedia, most of the
mathematics images have alternative text provided in \LaTeX, whereas Mathworld
contains AsciiMath markup. This form of hidden markup can then be displayed in
text-only browers or used for copy-and-paste operations,

In ChromeVox we exploit hidden markup as well, to ensure a consistent
screenreading experience of all mathematical content on the web.  In particular,
we rely on the MathJax library to translate hidden markup into a MathML
representation that we can speak instead. We describe in detail the treatment of
alternative representations in Sec.~\ref{sec:alternative}.
