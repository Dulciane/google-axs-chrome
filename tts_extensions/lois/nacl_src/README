This directory contains the source to the Native Client portion of
the Lois TTS extension for Chrome. To build it, you need the Native
Client SDK from:

  http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/

Then edit the Makefile to point to your SDK directory, and build by
running:

  make

When that succeeds, you'll get two .nexe files. Copy these into the
extension_src directory (in the parent of this directory) and load
the resulting extension in Chrome.
